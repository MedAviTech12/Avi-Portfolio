            This project focuses on detecting and analyzing the distinct types of EEG brain wavesâ€”namely delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gammaâ€”by examining their energy distribution using MATLAB. EEG waves represent various states of brain activity, with each wave type associated with specific mental and physical states, such as deep sleep, relaxation, or heightened focus. By using MATLAB's Power Spectral Density (PSD) functions, the project provides a quantitative assessment of the energy within each wave band, offering insights into brain function and potential applications in fields like cognitive science, neurology, and mental health. This analysis can also serve as a foundation for developing brain-computer interfaces or monitoring cognitive states in real-time</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In the conclusion of this EEG wave detection and energy distribution analysis project, we summarize the key findings, implications, limitations, and suggest potential improvements:<br>

            1. Findings: The project successfully detected various EEG wave typesâ€”delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gammaâ€”and quantified their energy distributions. This provided insights into brain wave patterns, offering valuable information on brain activity under specific conditions (e.g., relaxation, focus, sleep).<br>
            
            2. Implications: These findings have practical applications in neurology, psychology, and cognitive science. For instance, understanding the energy distribution across different EEG bands can help identify cognitive states, monitor sleep quality, detect neurological disorders, and even study responses to external stimuli.<br>
            
            3. Limitations: One limitation lies in potential signal noise that can interfere with wave detection, as well as limited sample sizes that may affect the generalizability of results. Moreover, the approach relies on MATLAB's Power Spectral Density function, which may have its own constraints regarding resolution and accuracy.<br>
            
            4. Potential Improvements: Future work could improve signal filtering techniques for better noise reduction, explore real-time EEG processing, and apply advanced algorithms like machine learning to classify EEG patterns more accurately. Additionally, expanding the dataset and integrating other software or tools could enhance robustness and applicability. <br>
            
            Overall, this study establishes a foundational approach to EEG wave analysis, highlighting areas for refinement and future research..</p>
